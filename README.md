Cogs for Discord-Red

So far there's just the Untappd Cog. If you'd like to use it you'll need an Untappd API key (https://untappd.com/api/dashboard). By default it will use https://aardwolf.github.io/tokenrevealer.html as the callback URL. I encourage you to take a loot at that and decide if it's safe enough for your purposes. It's hard-coded for now but easy enough to change.

The cog itself is used to interact with simple untappd calls - look up beers, display checkins, and toast checkins.
